# csgo-enhanced-bots
Tweaked botprofile.db file for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to make bots much more difficult.
Expert bots in CS:GO can be still too easy to play against, so this new bot profile tweaks the bot's aim and reaction time to make them faster and provide better practice.

## Features
 - Faster reaction times and better vision
 - Tweaked weapon buy profiles, removing unpopular weapons like shotguns (rifle bots will mainly buy AK/M4, sniper bots will mainly buy AWP/Scout)
 - Bots modeled after recent professional teams, with each player having stats roughly matching their skill
 
 ## Instructions
 - Simply replace your existing botprofile.db file (located in ...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo) and ensure Expert bots are selected in-game!
